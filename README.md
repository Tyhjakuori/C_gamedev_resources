## Introduction
This will be collection of tutorials, projects (and examples later on) written only/mainly in C.   
If you want some project, site removed from here please do create an issue or pull request for it.   
If you want to help me gather resources in one place, please do an issue or pull request.   
For the moment this will be my personal collection of tutorials & projects that i have found.   
Currently i have included SDL2, OpenGL, Vulkan and raylib as those i am interested in, this might expand in the future.
